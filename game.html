        <p>Camel</p>
        <br><p>Camels live in deserts, where it is hot and dry. Camels have adapted and found ways to help them survive in deserts. They have a thick coat of hair that protects them from the heat in the day, and keeps them warm at night. Their large feet spreads their weight on the sand when they are walking.</p>

        <p>Chameleon</p>
        <br><p>Habits. Most chameleons have a prehensile tail that they use to wrap around tree branches. ... Besides changing skin color, chameleons have another feature that no other animals have. Their eyes can move independently of each other, enabling them to look in two different directions at once.</p>

        <p> Cicada</p>
        <br><p>Cicadas are insects that spend most of their lives underground and emerge from the soil mainly to mate. Once out of the ground, their life span is fairly short, somewhere between two-four weeks. ... At present, there are about 15 active broods of these cicadas as some have gone extinct.</p>

        <br><p>The giant panda's scientific name is Ailuropoda melanoleuca, which means “black and white cat-foot”. 5. Giant pandas grow to between 1.2m and 1.5m, and weigh between 75kg and 135kg.

        <p>Pigeon</p>
       <br><p> Pigeons are intelligent birds. They can identify them on the mirror. ... Pigeons can easily detect distant storms, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions since they have a very sharp sense of hearing. Pigeons can carry messages to distant places and they were used as messengers during many wars.</p>
